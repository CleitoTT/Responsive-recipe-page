# Responsive recipe page
This is my first project in my career, and I really enjoyed the experience of working on this project.

### Overview
This is a small challenge of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) that asked us to build a webpage displaying a tutorial for an omelette recipe to test our HTML and CSS skills in creating a beautiful and responsive website.
